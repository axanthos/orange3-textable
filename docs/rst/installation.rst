Installation
============

Python v2.7 and Orange Canvas v2.7 (or more recent) must imperatively be
installed *before* Orange Textable. At the time of writing, most recent
versions of Orange Canvas automatically include the 2.7 version of Python.
After installation, Orange Textable appears in the form of an additional
tab in Orange Canvas.

The installation procedure is slightly different on Windows and MacOS X. [#]_
