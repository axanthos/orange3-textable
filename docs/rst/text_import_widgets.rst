Text import widgets
===================

Widgets of this category take no input and emit *Segmentation* data. Their
purpose is to import text data in Orange Canvas, either from the keyboard
(:doc:`Text Field <text_field>`), from files (:doc:`Text Files <text_files>`),
or from the Internet (:doc:`URLs <urls>`).
