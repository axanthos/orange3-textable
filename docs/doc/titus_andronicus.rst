Stylometric analysis of Shakespeare’s Titus Andronicus
==========================================================

(This use case was designed with the help of `Douglas
Duhaime <http://douglasduhaime.com/>`__ and the following text was
slightly adapted from a description kindly contributed by him.)

This is a case study in “stylometry”, or the quantitative analysis of a
writer’s style. The data to be analyzed is William Shakespeare’s play
*Titus Andronicus*, which scholars have long believed William
Shakespeare did not write alone. Since the publication of John
Robertson’s study *Did Shakespeare Write Titus Andronicus*, many have
believed that particular scenes within the text have been written by
other playwrights of the time: many believe that Act 1 Scene 1, for
instance, was written by Shakespeare’s contemporary George Peele.

In order to test this hypothesis, the following Orange Textable workflow
measures the degree to which the language in each scene within *Titus
Andronicus* resembles the language within each other scene (:ref:`figure 1 <titus_andronicus_schema>`
below). [#]_ By changing the **Mode** parameter within the **Intersect** instance,
one can elect to focus only on content words or stopwords, and by
changing the **Distance Metrics** parameter within the **Example
Distance** instance, one can change the similarity metric for the
language comparison. Finally, by clicking on the **Distance Map** icon
within this workflow, one can see at a glance how distinct the
vocabulary within each scene is.

Comparing the stopwords within each scene using a normalized Euclidean
distance metric, one finds that Act 1 Scene 1 is indeed a significant
outlier within *Titus Andronicus*. The scene remains an outlier when one
performs TF-IDF normalization on the term-document matrix (within the
**Convert** instance), and when one uses a normalized Manhattan distance
metric. Iterating through each of the various distance metrics, and
toggling between different normalization metrics, Act 1 Scene 1 remains
the most consistent outlier. This adds further evidence to the argument
that the scene’s stylistic fingerprint departs from that of that of the
rest of the play.
