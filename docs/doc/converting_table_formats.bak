Converting between table formats
================================

Orange Canvas has a "native" type for representing data tables, namely
*Table*. However, this type does not support Unicode well, which is a serious
limitation in the perspective of text processing. To overcome this issue (as
much as possible), Orange Textable defines its own Unicode-friendly table
representation format.

Every :doc:`table construction widget <table_construction_widgets>` in Orange
Textable emits data in the internal format of Orange Textable. Instances of
these widget must then be connected with an instance of :doc:`Convert <convert>`, which
has mainly two purposes:

    -   It *converts* data from Orange Textable's internal format to the
        native *Table* format of Orange Canvas, which makes it possible to
        use the other widgets of Orange Canvas for visualizing, modifying,
        analyzing, etc. tables built with Orange Textable.
        
    -   On demand, it *exports* data in *Table* format in tab-delimited
        format (either to a file or to the clipboard), typically in order to
        import them in a third-party data analysis software package; at the
        time of writing, this scenario is the only way to correctly visualize
        a table containing data encoded in Unicode.
        
As shown on :ref:`figure 1 <converting_table_formats_fig1>` below, section
**Encoding** of the widget's interface lets the user choose the encoding
of the *Table* object emitted by the widget (**Orange table**); variants of
Unicode should be avoided here since they are currently not well supported by
other widgets in Orange Canvas.

The encoding for text file export can also be selected in this section
(**Output file**); in this case there are no counter-indications to
the use of Unicode. Note that when exporting to the clipboard, the utf-8
encoding is used by default. Export proper is performed by clicking the
**Export** button and selecting the output file in the dialog that appears.

The take-home message here is this: when you create an instance of a
:doc:`table construction widget <table_construction_widgets>`, you should
systematically create a new instance of :doc:`Convert <convert>` and connect
them together. Usually, moreover, you will want to connect the
:doc:`Convert <convert>` instance to a *Data Table* instance (from the *Data*
tab of Orange Canvas) in order to view the table just built--except in the
case where it contains Unicode data that wouldn't display correctly in
*Data table*.
