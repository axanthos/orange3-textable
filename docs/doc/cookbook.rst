Cookbook
============

This section describes how to get a number of basic tasks done with
Orange Textable. Each task is explained by means of a concise,
illustrated recipe. The goal is to provide the user with a set of
elementary operations which, once properly chained, may form the basic
skeleton of various more ambitious projects.
