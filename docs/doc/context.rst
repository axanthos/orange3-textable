  Table displaying the concordance of key segments or their collocations.


Description
-----------
This widget inputs one or several segmentations and outputs concordances
or collocation lists in table format, allowing the user to examine the
contexts in which selected segments appear.

The functioning of this widget lies on the notions of units and contexts, as
all table contruction widgets. The role of the unit segmentation is central;
it defines the key segments whose contexts can be examined by means of the
resulting concordances or lists of collocations.

To take a simple example, consider two segmentations of the string *a simple
example* [#]_:

A) label = *words*

===========  =======  =====  ==================  =================
 content      start    end    *part of speech*    *word category*
===========  =======  =====  ==================  =================
 *a*          1        1      *article*           *grammatical*
 *simple*     3        8      *adjective*         *lexical*
 *example*    10       16     *noun*              *lexical*
===========  =======  =====  ==================  =================

B) label = *letters* (extract)

=========  =======  =====  ===================
 content    start    end    *letter category*
=========  =======  =====  ===================
 *a*        1        1      *vowel*
 *s*        3        3      *consonant*
 *i*        4        4      *vowel*
 ...        ...      ...    ...
 *e*        16       16     *vowel*
=========  =======  =====  ===================

The simplest case is when a single segmentation is considered; the only way
to define contexts is thus in terms of a given number of neighboring segments.
For example, given the single *letters* segmentation, we can build the
following concordance:

.. csv-table::
    :header: *__id__*, *__pos__*, *1L*, *__key_segment__*, *1R*
    :stub-columns: 1
    :widths: 1 1 3 3 3

    1,     1,     ---,    *a*,    *s*
    2,     2,     *a*,    *s*,    *i*
    3,     3,     *s*,    *i*,    *m*
    4,     4,     *i*,    *m*,    *p*
    5,     5,     *m*,    *p*,    *l*
    6,     6,     *p*,    *l*,    *e*
    7,     7,     *l*,    *e*,    *e*
    8,     8,     *e*,    *e*,    *x*
    9,     9,     *e*,    *x*,    *a*
    10,    10,    *x*,    *a*,    *m*
    11,    11,    *a*,    *m*,    *p*
    12,    12,    *m*,    *p*,    *l*
    13,    13,    *p*,    *l*,    *e*
    14,    14,    *l*,    *e*,    ---

In this table, the column *__id__* gives the index of each key segment (its
position in the table). The column *__pos__* indicates the position of each
key segment in the unit segmentation, and in this case this information
duplicates the previous one (we will see below that it is not always the
case). The key segment itself appears in the *__key_segment__* column, and its
direct neighbors on the left and the right appear respectively in the columns
*1L* and *1R*.

The number of neighbors shown on the left and right can of course be higher,
just as we can show the annotation values instead of the segment contents
(be it key segments or their neighbors). For example, the following table
gives 2 direct neighbors of each letter by showing their annotation value
for the key *letter category*:

.. csv-table::
    :header: *__id__*, *__pos__*, *2L*, *1L*, *__key_segment__*, *1R*, *2R*
    :stub-columns: 1
    :widths: 1 1 2 2 3 2 2

    1,     1,    ---,         ---,         *a*,  *consonant*,  *vowel*
    2,     2,    ---,         *vowel*,     *s*,  *vowel*,      *consonant*
    3,     3,    *vowel*,     *consonant*, *i*,  *consonant*,  *consonant*
    4,     4,    *consonant*, *vowel*,     *m*,  *consonant*,  *consonant*
    5,     5,    *vowel*,     *consonant*, *p*,  *consonant*,  *vowel*
    6,     6,    *consonant*, *consonant*, *l*,  *vowel*,      *vowel*
    7,     7,    *consonant*, *consonant*, *e*,  *vowel*,      *consonant*
    8,     8,    *consonant*, *vowel*,     *e*,  *consonant*,  *vowel*
    9,     9,    *vowel*,     *vowel*,     *x*,  *vowel*,      *consonant*
    10,    10,   *vowel*,     *consonant*, *a*,  *consonant*,  *consonant*
    11,    11,   *consonant*, *vowel*,     *m*,  *consonant*,  *consonant*
    12,    12,   *vowel*,     *consonant*, *p*,  *consonant*,  *vowel*
    13,    13,   *consonant*, *consonant*, *l*,  *vowel*,      ---
    14,    14,   *consonant*, *consonant*, *e*,  ---,          ---

The particularity of such tables is that they give the context of every
segment of the single considered segmentation. In general, we are
rather interested in certain specific segments, which we can indicate by means
of a distinct segmentation. Supposing that we have, in addition to the
*letters* segmentation, a segmentation whose label is *key_segments* and that
contains only the occurrences of letter *e* (always in the string *a simple
example*): [#]_

=========  =======  =====  ===================
 content    start    end    *letter category*
=========  =======  =====  ===================
 *e*        8        8      *vowel*
 *e*        10       10     *vowel*
 *e*        16       16     *vowel*
=========  =======  =====  ===================

By specifying the key segments with this segmentation and the contexts (here
the neighboring segments) with the *letters* segmentation, we can then produce
the following table:

.. csv-table::
    :header: *__id__*, *__pos__*, *2L*, *1L*, *__key_segment__*, *1R*, *2R*
    :stub-columns: 1
    :widths: 1 1 2 2 3 2 2

    1,  7,   *consonant*,  *consonant*,   *e*,  *vowel*,     *consonant*
    2,  8,   *consonant*,  *vowel*,       *e*,  *consonant*, *vowel*
    3,  14,  *consonant*,  *consonant*,   *e*,  ---,         ---

This example of a more typical concordance proves, for that matter, that the
position of the key segment in the table (column *__id__*) is not
necessarily equal to its position in the segmentation that defined the
contexts (column *__pos__*).

In the previous examples, the context of each key segment is defined
in the terms of the *neighboring* segments in a segmentation. Another
possibility is to define the context on the basis of another segmentation
whose segments *contain* the key segments. To illustrate this
second mode of context characterization, consider the case where units are
specified by the *key_segments* segmentation, as previously, and the contexts
by the *words* segmentation:

.. csv-table::
    :header: *__id__*, *__pos__*, *__left__*, *__key_segment__*, *__right__*
    :stub-columns: 1
    :widths: 2 3 3 5 3

    1,   2,    *simpl*,  *e*,  ---
    2,   3,    ---,      *e*,    *xample*
    3,   3,    *exampl*, *e*,    ---

This example shows the implications of this change of context specification
mode. Firstly, the resulting table now has a fixed width [#]_ of 5 columns:
*__id__* and *__key_segment__* have the same function as before; *__pos__*
indicates the position of the context segment that contains each key segment
(which allows the user to find and view the context in question with the
:doc:`Display <display>` widget); finally the columns *__left__* and *__right__*
respectively give the left and right part of each context segment containing a
key segment.

Moreover in this case, replacing the segment content with one of its
annotation values would not make much sense. However, it can be useful to
indicate such a value in a separate column, as *part of speech* in the
following example which also illustrates the possibility of replacing
the content of the key segment with an annotation value (here *letter
category*):

.. csv-table::
    :header: *__id__*, *__pos__*, *__left__*, *__key_segment__*, *__right__*, *part of speech*
    :stub-columns: 1
    :widths: 4 4 4 9 4 9

    1,  2,  *simpl*,  *vowel*, ---,      *adjective*
    2,  3,  ---,      *vowel*, *xample*, *noun*
    3,  3,  *exampl*, *vowel*, ---,      *noun*


These examples highlight the versatility of the **Context** widget, whose
possibilities are more diverse than those a basic concordancer typically
offers -- at the cost of a more complex application since it generally
involves being able to build and put in relation two or more distinct
segmentations of the analyzed text.

We conclude this overview of the capacities of the widget with the building
of collocation lists. First note that this functionality is here conceived
as a visualization option applicable to a concordance where the context is
defined in terms of the *neighboring* (rather than containing) segments.
Instead of representing the neighboring segments of each key segment
occurrence, we can in fact build a list of these (types of) segments with an
indication of the attraction or on the contrary repulsion between each of them
and the key segment.

Consider again the example of the concordance presented earlier where the
units are given by the *key_segments* segmentation and the context by the
*letter category* annotations values of the *letters* segmentation:

.. csv-table::
    :header: *__id__*, *__pos__*, *2L*, *1L*, *__key_segment__*, *1R*, *2R*
    :stub-columns: 1
    :widths: 1 1 2 2 3 2 2

    1,  7,   *consonant*,  *consonant*,   *e*,  *vowel*,     *consonant*
    2,  8,   *consonant*,  *vowel*,       *e*,  *consonant*, *vowel*
    3,  14,  *consonant*,  *consonant*,   *e*,  ---,         ---

The same data enable the program to produce the following collocation list:

.. csv-table::
    :header: "__unit__", *__mutual_info__*,    *__local_freq__*, *__local_prob__*, *__global_freq__*,    *__global_prob__*
    :stub-columns: 1
    :widths: 2 2 2 2 2 2

    *consonant*,    0.292781749228,     7,     0.7,    8,    0.571428571429
    *vowel*,        -0.51457317283,     3,     0.3,    6,    0.428571428571


The column *__mutual_info__* gives the mutual information (in bits) between
the key segment (here the letter *e)* and each value of the *letter category*
annotation that appeared close by (here at a maximum distance of 3 segments)
the key segments. This quantity is the binary logarithm of the ratio of the
probability of the *letter category* value in question close to the key
segment and its probability in the context segmentation in general.

Thus the *consonant* type appears 7 times in the surroundings of *e*
(*__local_freq__*), on a total of 10 segments that appeared close, hence the
"local" probability of 7/10 = 0.7 (*__local_prob__*); moreover the same type
appeared 8 times in the whole *letters* segmentation (*__global_freq__*), on a
total of 14 segments, hence the "global" probability of 8/14 = 0.57
(*__global_prob__*). Finally the binary logarithm of 0.7/0.57 = 1.22 is 0.3
bits (*__mutual_info__*), and this (slightly) positive value reflects the
(weak) attraction between *e* and the *consonant* type at a maximum distance
of 3 segments. Conversely, the negative mutual information between *e* and
*vowel* shows that these categories are in a rather repulsive relation in the
considered surrounding.

    Figure 1: Interface of the **Context** widget.

The widget interface (see :ref:`figure 1 <context_fig1>`) is divided in two
separate sections of unit specification (**Units**) and context specification
(**Contexts**). In the **Units** section, the **Segmentation** drop-down menu
allows the user to select among the input segmentations the one whose
segments will play the role of key segments. The **Annotation key** menu shows
the potential annotation keys associated to the chosen segmentation; if one of
the keys is selected the corresponding annotation values will be used; if on
the other hand the value *(none)* is selected, it will be the *content* of the
segments. The **Separate annotation** button, activated only when an
annotation key is selected, enables the user to indicate that the values
associated to this key must appear in a separate column (whose header is the
corresponding key) rather than replace the segment contents in the column
*__key_segment__*. Note that the two buttons (**Annotation key** and
**Separate annotation**) are disabled when the button **Use collocation
format** is selected.

In the **Context** section, the **Mode** menu allows the user to choose
between the two context characterization modes mentioned earlier: in terms of
*neighboring* segments of the key segment (**Neighboring segments**) or of
segments *containing* them (**Containing segmentation**). In both cases, the
segmentation in question is selected among the input segmentation through the
**Segmentation** drop-down menu and the **Annotation key** menu shows the
potential annotation keys associated to this segmentation. If one of these
keys is selected, the display of the corresponding values varies depending on
the **Mode** used: in **Neighboring segments** mode, the annotation values
replace the content of the segments in the columns *1R**, **1L**, ... ; in
**Containing segmentation** mode, they appear in a separate column whose
header is the corresponding annotation key.

In **Neighboring segments** mode, the **Contexts** section also allows the
user to indicate if a limit should be set to the number of neighboring
segments shown for each key segment and where it is set (**Max. distance**).
The **Use collocation format** button is used to format the result as a
collocation list (rather than a concordance); when it is selected, the
**Min. frequency** cursor allows the user to specify the (global)
minimal frequency that the segment type must reach in order to appear in the
list. Checking the **Treat distinct strings as contiguous** box permits to treat 
separate strings as if they were contiguous, so that the end of each string is a
djacent to the beginning of the next string.

.. _context_fig2:

.. figure:: figures/context_mode_containing_segmentation_example.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Context widget in "Containing segmentation mode"

    Figure 2: **Context** widget (Containing segmentation mode).

In **Containing segmentation mode** (see :ref:`figure 2 <context_fig2>`), the
**Contexts** section allows the user to specify the maximal number of
characters that appear in the right and left context of the pivot.

The **Send** button triggers the emission of a table in the internal format
of Orange Textable, to the output connection(s). When it is selected, the
**Send automatically** checkbox disables the button and the widget attempts
to automatically emit a segmentation at every modification of its interface or
when its input data are modified (by deletion or addition of a connection, or
because modified data is received through an existing connection).

The **Cancel** button interrupts the current process and therefore returns the widget to its precedent state.

The informations generated below the **Send** button indicate if a table was correctly emitted, or
the reasons why no table is emitted (typically, because it is empty).

Messages
--------

Information
~~~~~~~~~~~

*Table sent to output.*
    This confirms that the widget has operated properly.

Warnings
~~~~~~~~

*Widget needs input.*
    The widget instance is not able to emit data to output because it receives
    none on its input channel(s).

*Settings were* (or *Input has*) *changed, please click 'Send' when ready.*
    Settings and/or input have changed but the **Send automatically** 
    checkbox has not been selected, so the user is prompted to click the 
    **Send** button (or equivalently check the box) in order for computation 
    and data emission to proceed.

*Resulting table is empty.*
    No table has been emitted because the widget instance couldn't find a
    single element in its input segmentation(s). A likely cause for this 
    problem (when using the **Containing segmentation** mode) is that the unit
    and context segmentations do not refer to the same strings, so that the 
    units are in effect *not* contained in the contexts. This is typically a
    consequence of the improper use of widgets :doc:`Preprocess <preprocess>` and/or
    :doc:`Recode <recode>` (see :ref:`anchor_to_caveat`).
        
*Operation cancelled by user.*
    The user has stopped the widget from working.

.. [#] By convention, we do not indicate here the string index associated with
       each segment but only its start and end positions, along with the
       various annotation values associated with it; moreover, for the sake of
       readability, we do indicate the content of each segment, though it is
       not formally part of the segmentation (but rather of the string to
       which the segmentation refers).
.. [#] It is typically by means of the :doc:`Select <select>` widget that we could
       produce such a segmentation.
