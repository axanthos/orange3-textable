Case studies
================

This section aims to provide a repository of use cases illustrating the
application of Orange Textable to realistic text analysis problems. The
focus here is not so much on “how to” as it is on “why”. Each case study
comes with a downloadable Orange Textable workflow that can be studied
interactively and adapted to the specific needs of the user.
