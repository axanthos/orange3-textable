===========

Textable was initially designed and implemented by `LangTech
Sàrl <http://langtech.ch>`_ on behalf of the `department of language
and information sciences (SLI) <http://www.unil.ch/sli>`_ at the
`University of Lausanne (UNIL) <http://www.unil.ch>`_.

The largest part of funding was initially provided by the Unil’s
Teaching innovation fund (`Fonds d’innovation pédagogique -
FIP <http://www.unil.ch/fip>`_), and led to the release of Textable
v1.0 in summer 2012.

Textable’s development has continued between 2012 and 2013, still
carried on by `LangTech Sàrl <http://langtech.ch>`_, while the program
was being gradually integrated to courses taught at Unil’s department of
`SLI <http://www.unil.ch/sli>`_ (where most of the tutorials that would
later become the :doc:`Textable's Basics <textable_basics>` and :doc:`Advanced Topics <advanced_topics>` sections of this documentation have been
created).

In automn 2013, Textable became a registered Orange Canvas add-on and
was renamed to Orange Textable (v1.3). This promotion has made it
possible to reach a much larger pool of users, as witnessed by a
steadily increasing number of downloads.

In early 2014, Unil’s `FIP <http://www.unil.ch/fip>`_ has renewed its
support to Orange Textable by granting a maintenance funding. This has
made it possible for `LangTech Sàrl <http://langtech.ch>`_ to
collaborate with the creators of Orange Canvas, `University of
Ljubljana’s Biolab <https://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en/laboratory/biolab-27>`_
for producing version v1.4 of Orange Textable.

In the meantime, `UNIL’s Faculty of Arts <http://www.unil.ch/lettres>`_
has granted additional funding for translating Orange Textable’s User
guide from French to English, then converting it into the electronic
form you’re currently reading. UNIL’s `SLI
department <http://www.unil.ch/sli>`_ has provided some financial
support to the project in 2015, which made it possible to handle
warnings and error messages in a more user-friendly fashion in Orange
Textable v1.5.2.

In 2016, funding granted by several sources at UNIL (`SLI
department <http://www.unil.ch/sli>`_, Digital humanities and digital
cultures Lab, `Faculty of
Arts <https://www.unil.ch/lettres/fr/home.html>`_, and `Teaching and
technology support network <https://www.unil.ch/riset/fr/home.html>`_)
has made it possible to port Orange Textable to Python 3, enable it to
deal with very large datasets (with the help of `Arcanite
Solutions <https://arcanite.ch/>`_), as well as improve the ergonomy of
its interface, its presence on the web and its documentation (together
with `Uservalue <https://www.uservalue.ch/>`_).

In 2018, a partnership with the `National qualification programme
(BNF) <https://www.bnf.unibe.ch/index_eng.html>`_ has made it possible
to start updating Orange Textable’s documentation. This effort could
finally be pursued and finished in 2023-2024, when a new subsidy from `UNIL’s
Faculty of Arts <http://www.unil.ch/lettres>`_ made it possible to hire
three student assistants to work on the software’s documentation (Lliana
Doudot and André da Gloria Santiago) and its performance and responsiveness 
(Antonin Schnyder). This collective effort has led to the release of version 
3.2.0. The new responsiveness code was then further refactored by Johan Cuda as 
part of his MA project in Humanities computing at UNIL, leading to the release 
of version 3.2.1.

Besides `LangTech Sàrl <http://langtech.ch>`_ and `Aris
Xanthos <http://www.unil.ch/unisciences/arisxanthos>`_ who have been
involved at about every step of Orange Textable’s conception,
implementation, documentation, and so on, a special mention should be
made to Benjamin Gay (specifications, conception and implementation),
people at `Biolab <https://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en/laboratory/biolab-27>`_
(in particular Blaž Zupan and Aleš Erjavec for conception and
implementation work), Nadia Spang Bovey (project management), Corinne Morey 
(French to English translation of the user guide, preparation of the online 
version of the documentation, and creation of most cookbook recipes), Douglas 
Duhaime (case study design and write-up), and many students (and a growing 
number of scholars) notably at `Unil <http://www.unil.ch>`_ for their
indispensable feedback as users of Orange Textable.
