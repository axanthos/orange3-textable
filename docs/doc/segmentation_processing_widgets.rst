Segmentation processing widgets
===============================

Widgets of this category take *Segmentation* data in input and emit data of
the same type. Some of them (:doc:`Preprocess <preprocess>` and :doc:`Recode <recode>`) generate
modified text data. Others (:doc:`Merge <merge>`, :doc:`Segment <segment>`, :doc:`Select <select>`,
:doc:`Intersect <intersect>` and :doc:`Extract XML <extract_xml>`) do not generate new text data but
only new *Segmentation* data. :doc:`Display <display>`, finally, is mainly used to
visualize (or export) the details of a given *Segmentation* object (content
and address of segments, as well as their possible annotations).
