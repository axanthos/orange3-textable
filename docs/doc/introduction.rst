Introduction
============

Orange Textable is an open-source add-on bringing advanced
text-analytical functionalities to the `Orange Canvas <http://orange.biolab.si/>`_ data mining software (itself
open-source). It essentially enables users to build data tables on the
basis of text data, by means of a flexible and intuitive interface, e.
g. count the number of occurrences of certain words in different texts
and display the result with diagrams.

Orange Textable was initially designed and implemented by `LangTech
SÃ rl <http://langtech.ch>`_ on behalf of the `department of language
and information sciences (SLI) <http://www.unil.ch/sli/>`_ at the
`University of Lausanne <http://www.unil.ch>`_ (see :doc:`Credits <credits>`
and :doc:`How to cite Orange Textable <citing>`).
