Term frequency comparison in Melville’s Moby Dick
=====================================================

(This use case was designed with the help of `Douglas
Duhaime <http://douglasduhaime.com/>`__ and the following text was
slightly adapted from a description kindly contributed by him.)

This case study is adapted from Matthew Jocker’s excellent work *Text
Analysis with R for Students of Literature* (46). The goal here is to
visualize the frequency of the terms “Ahab” and “whale(s)” within Herman
Melville’s masterpiece *Moby Dick*. The workflow reproduced on :ref:`figure 1 <moby_dick_schema>`
below retrieves the text from `Project
Gutenberg <https://www.gutenberg.org/>`__, splits the work into its
constitutive chapters, and measures the degree to which each of the
target terms appears in each chapter. [#]_

Clicking on the **Scatter Plot** instance, one can easily see the
relative frequency of the term *whale(s)* in each chapter of Melville’s
novel (see :ref:`figure 2 <moby_dick_whales_vs_ahab>`
below). By toggling the **Y-axis Attribute** dropdown box, one can
select *Ahab* and visualize the frequency of *Ahab* in the novel.

Although one might have supposed that the distribution of Captain Ahab
would closely resemble that of whales within the novel, the plots above
tell a different story. While Ahab is most present in early and then
later chapters, whales are most present in the novel’s middle chapters,
creating something of an inverse relationship between the two. For the
literary critic, this relationship offers new evidence with which to
evaluate the strategy and structure of Melville’s novel.
