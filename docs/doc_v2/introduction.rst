Introduction
============

Orange Textable is an open-source add-on bringing advanced text-analytical
functionalities to the `Orange Canvas <http://orange.biolab.si/>`_ data mining
software package (itself open-source). It essentially enables users to build
data tables on the basis of text data, by means of a flexible and intuitive
interface. Look at the following :doc:`example <illustration>` to see it in
typical action.

Orange Textable was designed and implemented by `LangTech Sàrl
<http://langtech.ch>`_ on behalf of the `department of language and
information sciences (SLI) <http://www.unil.ch/sli>`_ at the `University of
Lausanne <http://www.unil.ch>`_ (see :doc:`Credits <credits>` and
:doc:`How to cite Orange Textable <citing>`).
