Case studies
============

This section aims to provide a repository of use cases illustrating the 
application of Orange Textable to realistic text analysis problems. The focus
here is not so much on "how to" as it is on "why". Each case study comes with
a downloadable Orange Textable scheme that can be studied interactively and
adapted to the specific needs of the user.
